In the above content, there are three places where you need to add your username:

    The first one is in the first line: put your name instead of <YOUR NAME>
    In the second statement, there are two places where you should put your username instead of <username>
    In the tech stack section I have added very few tech stacks just for this tutorial but you can add even more by adding the names of the tech. Head over to their docs to learn more about adding other icons.

Also, modify all the other fields according to your needs, all the information is personal so you have to edit most of the information. I have given my information here, so that you'll just need to fill up your details and get an updated profile pretty fast.
